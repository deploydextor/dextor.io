# Dextor Labs 

Welcome to **Dextor Labs**, where we create and showcase MVPs that include both proprietary and open-source projects. Each MVP is designed with a focus on functionality, ease of use, and a clean user experience.

### Tech Stack:
We use **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS** to build and style our MVPs, ensuring fast development and responsiveness.

### Plugins:
Currently, two official plugins are available for this setup:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
